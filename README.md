# jscc-node
This is an initial setup for a Node.js version of the JavaScript Compatibility Checker.

It is still a work in progress and can use your help to see if everything is done in a proper Node.js like fashion.

At the moment there is no report as a result of the module. If you have suggestion for the kind of output the module should generate I would love to hear from you.

Once some kind of output has been implemented I will submit the Node module to [npmjs.org](https://npmjs.org).
